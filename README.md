# Vetrinarian Terminal Application
This project is implementd in C and demonstrates core progamming principles. Such principles include the modularization 
of code through making various functions that complete different tasks which are all defined within their appropriate files. 
For example, the core.c and core.h files stores the functionality for taking in user input, and making displays in certain formats. 
The clinic.c and clinic.h file stores the functionality for performing CRUD operations with patient and appointment data. This project
also introduced me to the bubble sort algorithm, which orders the appointment data by date and patient data by patient number.
